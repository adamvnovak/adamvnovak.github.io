        <h1>Language Learning</h1>
        Now that I've been studying languages seriously since 2019 and people often ask how my Korean is so good, I wanted to share a list of my tips and tools.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Tips for Serious Language Learning</h2>
          <div class="projectList">
            <ul>
              <li><b>Consistency is key</b>. Build a habit of daily practice.</li>
              <li><b>Have fun with it</b>. You retain knowledge better and can go further if you're genuinely having fun, whatever that looks like for you.</li>
              <li><b>Don't study in libraries</b>. Choose places where you can speak aloud what you're reading or repeat back what you're listening to. This will strengthen your speaking skills at the same time.</li>
              <li><b>You have to put in the solo hours</b>. I see a lot of people trying to learn a language just with a tutor, friend, or language buddy. This is a nice supplement, but dedicated solo practice of repetition and memorization is the meat and potatoes of language learning.</li>
              <li><b>Get off Duolingo</b>. It's great as a one-stop-shop for picking up a bit of the language in a few weeks. But if you're a more serious student, you're better off combining tools that each serve one particular role best‚Äîa dedicated SRS like Anki, materials designed for one particular language like TalkToMeInKorean, etc.</li>
              <li><b>It's a fallacy that learning as an adult takes longer</b>. While kids can absorb knowledge faster than adults, adults can learn just as fast or faster on the whole thanks to their ability for sustained effort. An adult is far more capable of sitting down at a desk and studying a language for 5 hours a day, and this will take them far, quickly.</li>
              <li><b>Measure progress via hours.</b>. "I've studied for 4 years" or "I've studied for 5 months" doesn't mean much. Instead, ask yourself‚Äîhow many hours am I interacting with the language each week?.</li>
              <li><b>Passive listening isn't real practice</b>. It simply does not come close to the effectiveness of active listening at a desk with pen and paper. This is coming from someone who's spent thousands of hours walking around listening to Korean podcasts.</li>
              <li><b>Ultra learning is preferable when possible</b>. Spending months or years continuously, obsessively learning a language is both incredibly effective and rewarding. My Korean improved by far the most during my gap year in South Korea. </li>
              <li><b>Input is significantly more important than output early on</b>. This is beacuse 1) you generally listen and read more than you speak and write, 2) it gives you context & confidence to understand more of what's being said in a conversation, and 3) it's hard to speak beyond the limits of what you know sounds right.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <h2>Tools for Serious Language Learning</h2>
        <h4>All Languages</h4>
        <div class="projectList">
          <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="http://www.ankiweb.net">Anki</a>. Spaced reptition flashcards. An essential tool amongst language students.. and med students.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="http://www.workaway.info">Workaway</a>. A platform that connects host famillies with travelers. I spent a year living in Asia while volunteering through workaways, and they were a great way to get plugged into the local community and practice my target language. People in these communities tend to enjoy language exchange and are excited to help you improve.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="https://italki.com">Italki</a>. A solid place to find tutors for speaking practice if you're currently living in a place where you can't speak the language.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Korean</h4>
        <div class="projectList">
          <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="https://www.TalkToMeInKorean.com">TalkToMeInKorean</a>. TalkToMeInKorean produces loads of helpful and entertaining content. They are 100% worth the subscription. Their IYAGI and TalkToMeIn100%Korean audio series are especially great.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="https://HowToStudyKorean.com">HowToStudyKorean.com</a>. A great online substitute for an introductory textbook. The content is created by an English speaker, so he helps clarify a number of things a Korean might not be able to.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="https://en.dict.naver.com/#/main?sLn=en">Naver Dictionary</a>. I've seen too many Korean learners who ignorantly use Papago or Google Translate. Naver Dictionary is far better because 1) dictionary entries provide more than one single translation, and most words between English and Korean don't directly map 1-to-1, and 2) it's loaded with many real usage examples.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="https://koreanhanja.app/">Hanja Dict</a>. For every Korean word that is of Chinese origin, there are many other Korean words which share one of the component characters. Hanja Dict helps you define a new word in terms of words you already know by searching via component characters.
              <br><br>Imagine you know the word ÌåêÎß§Ï†ê (store) and ÏùåÏãù (food). If you come across the word ÏãùÏ†ê (a restaurant), you can use Hanja Dict to search up ÏãùÏ†ê and see that it has one character from ÏùåÏãù, one from ÌåêÎß§Ï†ê, so it's a split between food and store. Restaurant: a food store. Cool!</li>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id424389010">Dict Box</a>. The best iOS offline dictionary, for when you're studying on a plane, or the jungle, or space.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="https://tangerines.la/collections/clothing">ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî Hoodie</a>. Creates opportunities for spontaneous Korean conversations. Speaking from personal experience :)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Chinese</h4>
        <div class="projectList">
          <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="https://www.pleco.com/">Pleco</a>. Duh.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank"  href="https://rtega.be/chmn/index.php?subpage=41">Chinese Mnemonics</a> Mnemonics are proven to improve retention, but it's sometimes hard to think of a good one. This is a nice search engine for character mnemonics.</li>
            <li>More to come...</li>
