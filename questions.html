        <h2>Economic Cost of Distraction</h2>
        <p>
          Many of the biggest tech companies (Meta, Snap, Google) make more money the more time we spend using their apps (Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube). This means the US economy appears to be doing better when we're all watching videos on our phones.
          Even products with a less direct relationship between attention spent and money made, like video games, still aim to be as entertaining as possible, which keeps us spending more time on them. Countries like South Korea even consider video games an <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=3c23a2a2-ff65-468f-9867-86293b81b122">important part of their upcoming economic growth</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the short term, the economy appears to do better when adults are watching Reels instead of working and when kids are playing League of Legends instead of studying.
          Yet in the long term, this clearly doesn't add up. 
          The economy can't be propped up on artifical value creation forever. It seems like human capital is being overlooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lead quantity in household goods and tobacco products on the whole began to be regulated once the negative side effects were terminalized in terms of GDP dollars lost due to long-term healthcare costs. We should similarly aim to terminalize the distraction and unproductivity from addictive apps in terms of lower GDP.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Exactly how much is the economic cost of distraction?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How can we quantify this?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How might these results create a demand for better incentives and regulations around digital products and time well spent?</b>
